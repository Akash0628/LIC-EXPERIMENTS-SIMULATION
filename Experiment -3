# EXPERIMENT-3

A differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode noise, making it essential for precision applications like instrumentation and communication systems. It consists of two transistors or an operational amplifier with resistors to set the gain. The differential gain (Ad) is determined by resistor ratios, while the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) indicates how well the amplifier suppresses noise. Ideally, a high CMRR ensures minimal interference from external sources. Practical applications include signal conditioning, sensor amplification, and audio processing, where accurate differential signal amplification is crucial.
## Question:-

## Inference 
* The Id depends on Vb or Vincm value.
* If Vincm increases that side Id will decreases and vout will increase.
* Iss always in constant.
* High CMRR value indicates effective common mode noise rejection.
* Resistor mismatch affects the gain stability and reduces CMRR.
* To act as amplifeir, biasing ensures symmetrical.

## Final Conclusion
* Amplifies the difference between inputs while rejecting common-mode signals.
* Demonstrates a high CMRR when resistors are well-matched.
* Shows expected gain values, validating theoretical calculations.
* Exhibits some practical limitations, like resistor mismatch and power supply sensitivity.
